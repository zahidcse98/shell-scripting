- **What is Shell?**

  **Ans** A shell is a command-line interface (CLI) program that provides users with a way to interact with an operating system (OS) or computer. It serves as an intermediary between the user and the kernel (the core part of the operating system), allowing users to enter commands and receive responses from the computer. Shells are an integral part of Unix-like operating systems, such as Linux and macOS, as well as Windows operating systems (e.g., Command Prompt and PowerShell).
